## Generic Subdomains 

Some  parts  of  the  model  add  complexity  without  capturing  or  communicating  specialized knowledge. Anything extraneous makes the core domain harder to discern and understand. The  model  clogs  up  with general  principles  everyone  knows  or  details  that  belong  to specialties which are not your primary focus but play a supporting role. Yet, however generic, these other elements are essential to the functioning of the system and the full expression of the model. 

Therefore: 

**Identify  cohesive  subdomains  that  are  not the  motivation  for  your  project.  Factor  out generic models of these subdomains and place them in separate modules. Leave no trace of your specialties in them.** 

**Once they have been separated, give their continuing development lower priority than the core domain, and avoid assigning your core developers to the tasks (because they will gain little  domain  knowledge  from  them).  Also  consider  off‐the‐shelf  solutions  or  published models for these generic subdomains.**
